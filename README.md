The project titled QuickBite is an online grocery shopping web application developed using Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles. Its goal is to enhance user satisfaction, usability, and efficiency in online shopping.
The application provides three login options: phone number (OTP), Google, and Facebook.
Phone login uses OTP verification with a 30-second timer and resend functionality.
Google and Facebook logins require solving a numerical CAPTCHA.
After login, a circular loading bar guides the user to the homepage.
The homepage displays trending offers and a search bar with auto-suggestions.
It includes a user account section, delivery location, and shopping cart.
Categories like Fruits, Vegetables, Dairy, and Bakery are displayed for easy access.
Users can navigate these categories to explore and add products to their cart.
Clicking on a product shows details like price, quantity, nutrition info, and FAQs.
Users can also favorite products using a heart icon.
Popular and recently viewed items are showcased under "Most Popular".
Special sections like “Fresh Fruits and Vegetables” have “Shop Now” buttons.
The footer includes links to social media, policies, and contact information.
The cart page displays order summary, promo code option, and editable item list.
Promo code “FRESH10” applies a 10% discount.
Users can delete items or adjust quantities using plus and minus buttons.
Proceeding to checkout shows a 3-step flow: delivery info, payment, confirmation.
Delivery info includes optional instructions and address saving for future use.
Payment methods include Credit/Debit card and Cash on Delivery (COD).
Card payments require number, name, expiry date, and CVV.
Reviewing the order precedes the final placement.
The confirmation page shows “Order Confirmed” and a live delivery tracker.
Stages like “Preparing Order” and “Out for Delivery” are animated.
